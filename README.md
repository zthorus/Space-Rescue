# Space-Rescue
Space-Rescue, game for the ZX Spectrum

Space-Rescue is a game for the ZX Spectrum computer. It was written (in Basic with Z80 assembly routines) in 1985, and then was updated 
in 2012 (the sprite-collision detection algorithm was improved). The repository consists of a .z80 snapshot file that can be used
with most of the ZX Spectrum emulators (ZXSP, Fuse, ...). The introduction text is french but the game is simple: use 5, 8  (direction)
and 0 (brake) keys to move the ship (first to land and rescue a prisoner, then to dock inside the mothership, dodging the asteroids and
satellites).
